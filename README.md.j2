# Coronavirus statistics data in Shanghai lockdown

[![Crawl & Parse Data](https://github.com/lewangdev/shanghai-lockdown-covid-19/actions/workflows/update.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lewangdev/shanghai-lockdown-covid-19/actions/workflows/update.yml)

No entire COVID-19 statistics data of the Shanghai lockdown period can be found in the [JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) project. Data of project [shanghai-lockdown-covid-19](https://github.com/lewangdev/shanghai-lockdown-covid-19) is crawled from [Shanghai Government](https://wsjkw.sh.gov.cn/yqtb/)'s public website, began on 19/03/2022, the date of my place lockdown.

Shanghai is divided by the Huangpu River into two parts, the Pudong area, and the Puxi area. Pudong's lockdown began on 28/03/2022 firstly, and Puxi started its shutdown on 01/04/2022. 

__Shanghai Government has announced its city-wide lockdowns will be gradually lifted from 1 June on 16/05/2022, after 15 out of 16 districts achieving "social dynamic Zero-Covid cases". My place alse reopened on the same day, but with some limits.__
